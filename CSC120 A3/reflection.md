Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Lucy, Zoe, Lauren, Jo
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    Tuesday Jordan's office hours
    Johanna's office hours
    Tuesday, and Wednesday TA hours 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    It is difficult to code yet I have a better understanding of how we can use the program thanks to all of the office hours and TA hours I have attended. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    For not, I'm not able to. But I believe learning fundamentals of how to code in two codes would help me to understand those. I will try to learn it by myself this weekend. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Going to the office hours and TA hours helped me a lot, but I learned how knowing fundamentals are essential to coding (how to structure codes etc). I am familiar with C++ but Java seems a lot different that I take so much time figuring out. I would recommend to get some grasp of how to structure your codes in Java by yourself before the class.
